    >:
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Set a large Moroccan Tagine (or large skillet with tight fitting lid) over
            low heat. Add the oil, chopped onions, chopped cilantro, minced garlic,
            and fresh grated ginger. Sauté for several minutes minutes until the
            onions soften.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, mix in the cumin, coriander, cinnamon and rice. Stir and toast the
            spices and rice another couple of minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the diced tomatoes, chickpeas, raisins, apricots, lemon zest and
            juice, and 1 ½ teaspoons salt to the rice. Mix well and spread evenly
            across the bottom of the pan. Then pour 1 ½ cups water over the top. No
            need to stir!
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the cover over the tagine and cook for 15-20 minutes. Do not lift
            the lid until the 15 minutes mark. The rice should look dry on top, and
            there should be a vent hole apparent. If it does not look fully cooked,
            cover and continue cooking for 5 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you plan to add fish at the end, first pat the fish fillets dry and
            then salt and pepper them liberally on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the rice has cooked for at least 15 minutes, lay the fish fillets
            over the top of the rice and cover again. You can either turn off the heat
            and let them steam for 5-10 minutes; or, if needed, you can continue
            cooking the rice for another 5 minutes, then turn off the heat. Either
            way, fish fillets under ½ inch thick will cook through on top of the rice
            in 5-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once cooked, remove the lid and sprinkle the top with fresh chopped mint,
            cilantro, and toasted almonds.
        </li>
        <li>Serve warm with pickled red onion on the side, if you like.</li>
        <li>
            Cooked with fish, leftovers of this dish will keep well in an airtight
            container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Vegan versions of this
            Moroccan tagine recipe will be good for up to 5 days in the fridge.
